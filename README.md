### a description of the course

In UP 206A, we will learn to convert data into effective visualizations and maps through Python. We will understand how to manage and leverage data to expose and communicate urban spatial analysis that is critical to addressing issues in urban planning including, but not limited to, social justice, transportation, sustainability, and housing. The class will consist of an introduction to coding and programming with Python, and spatial analysis through Python libraries and geoprocessing. This course is different than other GIS courses in that it teaches you how to have more control of your mapmapking compared to other "off-the-shelf" programs like ESRI. Students will leave the course with a firm understanding of how to interpret, analyze, and visualize data for planning purposes and research.     

### project ideas

- Map of collisions on streets that host bus lanes compared to streets with no bus lanes
- Map that compares reported police incidents around current rail transit stations ten years before and after installation
- Changes in property values around affordable housing developments
- Where street cleaning is in effect overlayed with neighborhood incomes
- Map of affordable housing developments in Los Angeles overlayed with neighborhood incomes 
- Map of bicycle-involved collisions relative to existing bicycle infrastructure
- Map of how LA City Council redistricting has effected the potency of the Black, Latinx, and Asian vote in the city
- Map of 2021 eviction rates and historic redlined maps
- Map of frequency of fulfilled 311 city services requests and income/race 
- Map of fare evasion tickets relative to income in Los Angeles and San Francisco
- Map of private equity-owned residential properties in LA from 2001-2006 and 2007-2012 

### objectives for the class

My objective for the course is to learn how to manage and convert data into visualizations that communicate a clear narrative. I would like to feel confident in using Python so I can apply its coding language to other means such as statistical analysis and web development.
